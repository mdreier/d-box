# D-Box - A DosBox Frontend

This project started out as a copy of the original [D-Box project on Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/dbox/).
As Google Code has shut down and there seems to be no further activity by the original author I decided to bring this project
to Github to continue the work.

The first step has been to build the project with a current Java version (JDK 1.8). Further steps will be a cleanup of the project,
and later bugfixes and new features. 

## Description

D-Box is a simple, yet powerful front-end for DosBox. It provides a slick GUI that allows users to run games and 
applications through DosBox without writing any cryptic commands. It strives to be easy to use and not too complicated. 
D-Box is multi-platform, and supports all platforms that DosBox does. D-Box is open source. 

Important: D-Box is a Java program! You'll need Java 1.6 or higher to run it. If you don't manage to run it, please 
go to https://www.java.com and download it!
